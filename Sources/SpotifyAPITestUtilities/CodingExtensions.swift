/**
 Encodes the object into data, then decodes it again (2x) and ensures that the
 decoded version matches the value that was originally passed in. This ensures
 that no information was lost or changed during encoding and decoding.
 
 - Parameters:
   - object: The object to encode and decode.
   - file: A file name. Defaults to the file name of the test case in which this
         function was called.
   - line: A line number. Defaults to the line number on which this function was
         called.
 - Returns: The data converted into a string.
