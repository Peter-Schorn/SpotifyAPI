/**
 Communicates with a backend server that you setup in order to retrieve the
 authorization information and refresh the access token using the Authorization
 Code Flow.

 This server must have the following endpoints:
 
 * ``tokensURL``: Accepts a post request with the authorization code in the
   body in x-www-form-urlencoded format and must return the authorization
   information. See
   ``requestAccessAndRefreshTokens(code:redirectURIWithQuery:)`` for more
   information.
 
 * ``tokenRefreshURL``: Accepts a post request with the refresh token in the body
   in x-www-form-urlencoded format and must return the authorization
   information. See ``refreshTokens(refreshToken:)`` for more information.

 Instead of creating your own server, you can use [SpotifyAPIServer][2] with
 this type by assigning the /authorization-code-flow/retrieve-tokens endpoint to
 ``tokensURL`` and the /authorization-code-flow/refresh-tokens endpoint to
 ``tokenRefreshURL``.

 In contrast with ``AuthorizationCodeFlowClientBackend``, which can be used if
 you are communicating directly with Spotify, this type does not send the
 `clientId`, or `clientSecret` in network requests because these values should
 be securely stored on your backend server.

 This conforms to the ["Token Swap and Refresh"][3] standard used in the Spotify
 iOS SDK.

     Exchanges an authorization code for the access and refresh tokens.
     
     After validating the `redirectURIWithQuery`, the
     ``AuthorizationCodeFlowBackendManager/requestAccessAndRefreshTokens(redirectURIWithQuery:state:)``
     method of ``AuthorizationCodeFlowBackendManager`` calls this method in
     order to retrieve the authorization information.
     
     If the `redirectURIWithQuery` contains an error parameter or the value for
     the state parameter doesn't match the value passed in as an argument to the
     above method, then an error will be thrown *before* this method is called.
     
     This method makes a post request to ``tokensURL``. The headers will contain
     the "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" header and the body
     will contain the following in x-www-form-urlencoded format:
     
     * "grant_type": set to "authorization_code"
     * "code": the authorization code
     * "redirect_uri": the redirect URI
     
     For example: "grant_type=authorization_code&code=asd...xbdjc
     &redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080". See ``ProxyTokensRequest``, which is
     used to encode this data.
     
     The endpoint at ``tokensURL`` must return the authorization information as
     JSON data that can be decoded into ``AuthInfo``. The
     ``AuthInfo/accessToken``, ``AuthInfo/refreshToken``, and
     ``AuthInfo/expirationDate`` (which can be decoded from the "expires_in"
     JSON key) properties must be non-`nil`. For example:
     
     ```
     {
         "access_token": "NgCXRK...MzYjw",
         "token_type": "Bearer",
         "scope": "user-read-private user-read-email",
         "expires_in": 3600,
         "refresh_token": "NgAagA...Um_SHo"
     }
     ```
     
     Any error that your backend server receives from the Spotify web API, along
     with the headers and status code, should be forwarded directly to the
     client, as this library already knows how to decode these errors.
     
     After the response is retrieved from the server, ``decodeServerError`` is
     called in order to decode any custom error objects that your server might
     return.
