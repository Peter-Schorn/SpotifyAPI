/**
 Manages the authorization process for the Client Credentials Flow.
 
 The Client Credentials flow is used in server-to-server authentication. Only
 endpoints that do not access user information can be accessed. This means that
 endpoints that require [authorization scopes][2] cannot be accessed. The
 advantage of this authorization process is that no user interaction is
 required.
 
 **Backend**
 
 This class is generic over a backend. The backend handles the process of
 requesting the authorization information from Spotify. It may do so directly
 (see ``ClientCredentialsFlowClientBackend``), or it may communicate with a
 custom backend server that you configure (see
 ``ClientCredentialsFlowProxyBackend``). This backend server can safely store
 your client id and client secret and retrieve the authorization information
 from Spotify on your behalf, thereby preventing these sensitive credentials
 from being exposed in your frontend app. See ``ClientCredentialsFlowBackend``
 for more information.
 
 **If you do not have a custom backend server, then you are encouraged to use**
 **the concrete subclass of this class,** ``ClientCredentialsFlowManager``
 **instead**. It inherits from
 ``ClientCredentialsFlowBackendManager``<``ClientCredentialsFlowClientBackend``>. This
 class will store your client id and client secret locally.

 **Authorization**

 The only method you must call to authorize your application is ``authorize()``.
 After that, you may begin making requests to the Spotify web API. The access
 token will be refreshed for you automatically when needed.

 Use ``deauthorize()`` to set the ``accessToken`` and ``expirationDate`` to
 `nil`.
 
 **Persistent Storage**

 Note that this type conforms to `Codable`. It is this type that you should
 encode to data using a `JSONEncoder` in order to save the authorization
 information to persistent storage. See
 <doc:Saving-the-Authorization-Information-to-Persistent-Storage> for more
 information.

     The [Client Credentials Flow][1] does not provide a refresh token, so
     calling this method and passing in `false` for `onlyIfExpired` is
     equivalent to calling ``authorize()``.

     **Thread Safety**
     
     Calling this method is thread-safe. If a network request to refresh the

     **However**, No guarantees are made about the thread that the publisher

       - onlyIfExpired: Only retrieve a new access token if the current one is

       - tolerance: The tolerance in seconds to use when determining if the
             token is expired. Defaults to 120, meaning that a new token will be
             retrieved if the current one has expired or will expire in the next
             two minutes. The token is considered expired if ``expirationDate``
             - `tolerance` is equal to or before the current date. This

/**
 Manages the authorization process for the Client Credentials Flow.

 The Client Credentials flow is used in server-to-server authentication. Only
 endpoints that do not access user information can be accessed. This means that
 endpoints that require [authorization scopes][2] cannot be accessed. The
 advantage of this authorization process is that no user interaction is
 required.

 This class stores the client id and client secret locally. Consider using
 ``ClientCredentialsFlowBackendManager``<``ClientCredentialsFlowProxyBackend``>,
 which allows you to setup a custom backend server that can store these
 sensitive credentials and which communicates with Spotify on your behalf in
 order to retrieve the authorization information.

 **Authorization**

 The only method you must call to authorize your application is
 ``ClientCredentialsFlowBackendManager/authorize()``. After that, you may begin
 making requests to the Spotify web API. The access token will be refreshed for
 you automatically when needed.
 
 Use ``ClientCredentialsFlowBackendManager/deauthorize()`` to set the
 ``ClientCredentialsFlowBackendManager/accessToken`` and
 ``ClientCredentialsFlowBackendManager/expirationDate`` to `nil`. Does not
 change ``clientId`` or ``clientSecret``, which are immutable.

 **Persistent Storage**

 Note that this type conforms to `Codable`. It is this type that you should
 encode to data using a `JSONEncoder` in order to save the authorization
 information to persistent storage. See
 <doc:Saving-the-Authorization-Information-to-Persistent-Storage> for more
 information.
