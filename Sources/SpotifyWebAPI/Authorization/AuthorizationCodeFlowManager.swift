/**
 Manages the authorization process for the [Authorization Code Flow][1].
 
 For applications where it is unsafe to store your client secret, consider
 using `AuthorizationCodeFlowPKCEManager`, which manages the
 [Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange][2]; it provides
 an additional layer of security.
 
 The first step in the authorization code flow is to make the
 authorization URL using
 `makeAuthorizationURL(redirectURI:showDialog:state:scopes:)`.
 Open this URL in a broswer/webview to allow the user to login
 to their Spotify account and authorize your application.
 
 After they either authorize or deny authorization for your application,
 Spotify will redirect to the redirect URI specified in the authorization
 URL with query parameters appended to it. Pass this URL into
 `requestAccessAndRefreshTokens(redirectURIWithQuery:state:)` to request
 the refresh and access tokens. After that, you can begin making requests
 to the Spotify API. The access token will be refreshed for you
 automatically when needed.
 
 Note that this type conforms to `Codable`. It is this type that you should
 encode to data using a `JSONEncoder` in order to save it to persistent storage.
 See this [article][3] for more information.
 
 Use `isAuthorized(for:)` to check if your application is authorized
 for the specified scopes.
 
 Use `deauthorize()` to set the `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expirationDate`,
 and `scopes` to `nil`. Does not change `clientId` or `clientSecret`,
 which are immutable.
 
 Contains the following properties:
 
 * The client id
 * The client secret
 * The access token
 * The refresh token
 * The expiration date for the access token
 * The scopes that have been authorized for the access token

     The first step in the [Authorization Code Flow][1].
     
     Creates the URL that is used to request authorization for your app. It
     displays a permissions dialog to the user. Open the URL in a
     browser/webview so that the user can login to their Spotify account and
     authorize your app.
     
     After the user either authorizes or denies authorization for your
     application, Spotify will redirect to `redirectURI` with query parameters
     appended to it. Pass that URL into
     `requestAccessAndRefreshTokens(redirectURIWithQuery:state:)` to complete
     the authorization process.
     
     # Warning:
     
     **DO NOT add a forward-slash to the end of the redirect URI**.
     
     All of these values will be automatically percent-encoded.
     Therefore, do not percent-encode them yourself before passing them
     into this method.

     - Parameters:
       - redirectURI: The location that Spotify will redirect to
             after the user authorizes or denies authorization for your app.
             Usually, this should be a custom URL scheme that redirects to a
             location in your app. This URI needs to have been entered in the
             Redirect URI whitelist that you specified when you
             [registered your application][2].
       - showDialog: Whether or not to force the user to approve the app again
             if they’ve already done so. If `false`, a user who has already
             approved the application may be automatically redirected to the
             `redirectURI`. If `true`, the user will not be automatically
             redirected and will have to approve the app again.
       - state: Optional, but strongly recommended. **If you provide a value**
             **for this parameter, you must pass the same value to**
             `requestAccessAndRefreshTokens(redirectURIWithQuery:state:)`,
             **otherwise an error will be thrown.** The state can be useful for
             correlating requests and responses. Because your redirect URI can
             be guessed, using a state value can increase your assurance that
             an incoming connection is the result of an authentication request
             that you made. If you generate a random string or encode the hash of
             some client state (e.g., a cookie) in this state variable, you can
             validate the response to additionally ensure that the request and
             response originated in the same browser. This provides protection
             against attacks such as cross-site request forgery.
       - scopes: A set of [Spotify Authorization scopes][3].
     - Returns: The URL that must be opened to authorize your app. May return
           `nil` if the URL could not be created.

     The second and final step in the [Authorization Code Flow][1].
     
     After you open the URL from
     `makeAuthorizationURL(redirectURI:scopes:showDialog:state:)`
     and the user either authorizes or denies authorization for your app,
     Spotify will redirect to the redirect URI you specified with query
     parameters appended to it. Pass this URL into this method to request
     access and refresh tokens. The access token is required for all endpoints,
     even those that do not access user data.
     
     If the user denied your app's authorization request or the request failed
     for some other reason, then `SpotifyAuthorizationError` will be thrown to
     downstream subscribers. Use the `accessWasDenied` boolean property of this
     error to check if the user denied your app's authorization request.
     
     If the request for the access and refresh tokens suceeds, `self.didChange`
     will emit a signal, which causes `SpotifyAPI.authorizationManagerDidChange`
     to emit a signal.
     
     - Parameters:
       - redirectURIWithQuery: The redirect URI with query parameters appended to
             it.
       - state: The value of the state parameter that you provided when
             making the authorization URL. The state can be useful for
             correlating requests and responses. Because your redirect URI can
             be guessed, using a state value can increase your assurance that
             an incoming connection is the result of an authentication request
             that you made. **If the state parameter in the query string of**
             `redirectURIWithQuery` **doesn't match this value, then an error will**
             **be thrown.** If `nil`, then the state parameter must not be present
             in `redirectURIWithQuery` either, otherwise an error will be thrown.
             After this request has been made, you should generate a new value
             for this parameter in preparation for the next authorization process.
