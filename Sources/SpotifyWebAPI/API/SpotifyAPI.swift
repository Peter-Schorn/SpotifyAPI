/**
 The central class in this library. Provides methods for all of the Spotify web
 API endpoints and contains an authorization manager for managing the
 authorization process of your application.

 The methods that require authorization scopes and/or an access token that was
 issued on behalf of a user are declared in conditional conformances where
 `AuthorizationManager` conforms to ``SpotifyScopeAuthorizationManager``. This
 protocol requires conforming types to support authorization scopes. This
 strategy provides a compile-time guarantee that you cannot call methods that
 require authorization scopes if you are using an authorization manager that
 doesn't support them.

 ``AuthorizationCodeFlowBackendManager`` and
 ``AuthorizationCodeFlowPKCEBackendManager`` conform to
 ``SpotifyScopeAuthorizationManager``. ``ClientCredentialsFlowBackendManager``
 is not a conforming type because it does not support authorization scopes.

 All of the endpoints are documented at the the [web API reference][1].
