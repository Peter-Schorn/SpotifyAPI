 The data from the Spotify web API could not be decoded into any of the

 Assign a folder URL to the static var ``dataDumpFolder`` to write the json
 response from the Spotify web API to disk when instances of this error are
 created. See ``writeToFolder(_:)``. This is intended for debugging purposes.
 It it initialized to the path specified by the "SPOTIFY_DATA_DUMP_FOLDER" environment
 variable, if it exists. You can change this if necessary.

 This error is almost always due to a bug in this library. File a bug report
 if you get this error.
 
 Do not `dump` this error; instead, use its string representation for
 debugging (e.g., print it to the standard output, use string interpolation
 or use `String(describing:)`). Use ``localizedDescription`` for displaying
 the error to the end user.
