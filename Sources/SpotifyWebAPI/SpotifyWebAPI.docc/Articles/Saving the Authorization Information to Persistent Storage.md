# Saving the Authorization Information to Persistent Storage

Save the authorization information to persistent storage so that the user does not have to login again every time the application is quit and re-launched.

The ``SpotifyAPI/authorizationManager`` property of the ``SpotifyAPI`` class is what contains the authorization information. It always conforms to `Codable`. It is this property that you should encode to data using a `JSONEncoder` and save to persistent storage. You can then retrieve this data from persistent storage at a later time and decode it using a `JSONDecoder`. Note that the ``SpotifyAPI/authorizationManager`` property is a mutable `var` property; you can retrieve the authorization information from storage as many times as you need to and assign it to this property.

You must keep in mind the fact that the access token expires after an hour. This library automatically refreshes the access token when necessary, so you shouldn't have to worry about refreshing it manually, although you do have to make sure that you re-save the ``SpotifyAPI/authorizationManager`` property to persistent storage every time this happens. This is why ``SpotifyAPI`` has an ``SpotifyAPI/authorizationManagerDidChange`` `PassthroughSubject`, which emits any time that the authorization information changes. Subscribe to this publisher so that you can re-save ``SpotifyAPI/authorizationManager`` to persistent storage every time this publisher emits. ``SpotifyAPI`` also has an ``SpotifyAPI/authorizationManagerDidDeauthorize`` `PassthroughSubject` that emits whenever `SpotifyAPI.authorizationManager.deauthorize()` is called. Subscribe to this publisher in order to remove the authorization information from persistent storage.

The authorization information is sensitive, so *never* save it to UserDefaults. Instead, you are encouraged to save it to the keychain or to encrypt it yourself and save it to a secure location. 

The following examples use Kishikawa's [Keychain Access](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/KeychainAccess) library to save the authorization information to the keychain.

Here is a class which manages an instance of ``SpotifyAPI``; it uses ``AuthorizationCodeFlowManager`` for the authorization process, but similar steps apply to the other authorization managers as well. It subscribes to changes to the authorization information and saves them to the keychain and provides a convenience method for authorizing the application. It also conforms to the `ObservableObject` object protocol, which means that you can use it inside of a SwiftUI view. 

You are strongly encouraged to inject an instance of this class into the root of your view hierarchy as an environment object using the `environmentObject(_:)` view modifier.

See also this [example app](https://github.com/Peter-Schorn/SpotifyAPIExampleApp), which uses this class.
