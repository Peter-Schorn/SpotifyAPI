# Working with Paginated Results

Retrieve additional pages from an endpoint that returns paginated results.

## Overview

For endpoints that deal with data that is too large to fit into a single response, such as ``SpotifyAPI/artistAlbums(_:groups:country:limit:offset:)`` and ``SpotifyAPI/recentlyPlayed(_:limit:)``, Spotify uses a ``PagingObject`` or a ``CursorPagingObject`` to split up the results into multiple pages.

This library provides several convenience methods for requesting additional pages of results from a paginated type, as well as manual methods for requesting specific individual pages.

## Requesting Additional Pages of Results Serially

**`Publisher.extendPages(_:maxExtraPages:)` and ``SpotifyAPI/extendPages(_:maxExtraPages:)``** 

This publisher extension can be chained with any publisher that returns a ``PagingObject`` or a  ``CursorPagingObject``.  It uses the `next` property of the paging object sent from the upstream publisher to request the next page of results. Each time an additional page is received, its `next` property is used to retrieve the next page of results, and so on, until `next` is `nil` or `maxExtraPages` is reached. This means that the next page will not be requested until the previous one is received and that the pages will always be returned in order.

In this example, a request is made for an artist's albums. 10 albums per page and two additional pages, for a total of three pages, are requested:

```swift
let artist = "spotify:artist:0k17h0D3J5VfsdmQ1iZtE9"

spotifyAPI.artistAlbums(artist, country: "US", limit: 10)
    .extendPages(spotifyAPI, maxExtraPages: 2)
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            print("completion: \(completion)")
        },
        receiveValue: { albumsPage in
            print(
                """

                received page of albums:
                ------------------------
                """
            )
            for album in albumsPage.items {
                print(album.name)
            }
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

Output:
```

## Requesting Additional Pages of Results Concurrently

**`Publisher.extendPagesConcurrently(_:maxExtraPages:)` and ``SpotifyAPI/extendPagesConcurrently(_:maxExtraPages:)``**

This publisher extension requests additional pages of results *concurrently*, which means it is much faster than the above method, which must wait for the previous page to be received before requesting the next page. **However, the order in which the pages are received is unpredictable.** If you need to wait all pages to be received before processing them, then always use this method.

In this example, the tracks and episodes in a playlist are requested. 5 items per page and 5 additional pages, for a total of 6 pages, are requested.

```swift
let playlist = "spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DWXRqgorJj26U"

spotifyAPI.playlistItems(playlist, limit: 5, market: "US")
    .extendPagesConcurrently(spotifyAPI, maxExtraPages: 5)
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            print("completion: \(completion)")
        },
        receiveValue: { playlistItemsPage in
            print(
                """

                received \(playlistItemsPage.items.count) tracks:
                ------------------------
                """
            )
            for track in playlistItemsPage.items.compactMap(\.item) {
                print(track.name ?? "nil")
            }
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

## Collecting all Pages of Results

**`Publisher.collectAndSortByOffset()`**

This publisher waits for all pages to be received and then sorts them based on the page they were received in and returns just the items in the pages.

For example:

```swift
let album = "spotify:album:5iT3F2EhjVQVrO4PKhsP8c"

spotifyAPI.albumTracks(album, market: "US", limit: 20)
    .extendPagesConcurrently(spotifyAPI)
    .collectAndSortByOffset()
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            print("completion: \(completion)")
        },
        receiveValue: { tracks in
            print("received \(tracks.count) tracks:")
            for track in tracks {
                print(track.name)
            }
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

## Manually Requesting Specific Pages

You can manually retrieve the next and previous page of a ``PagingObject`` by passing the  ``PagingObject/next`` and ``PagingObject/previous`` properties, respectively, into  ``SpotifyAPI/getFromHref(_:responseType:)``.

```swift
let dispatchGroup = DispatchGroup()

/// The full URL to the next page of results
var nextHref: URL? = nil

dispatchGroup.enter()
spotifyAPI.currentUserTopArtists()
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            print("completion: \(completion)")
            dispatchGroup.leave()
        },
        receiveValue: { artistsPage in
            print("received \(artistsPage.items.count) artists:")
            for artist in artistsPage.items {
                print(artist.name)
            }
            // MARK: Retrieve the next property of the paging object
            nextHref = artistsPage.next
            
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)

dispatchGroup.wait()

// request the next page if `nextHref` is non-`nil`.
if let nextHref = nextHref {
    
    print("\n\nrequesting next page of artists")
    dispatchGroup.enter()
    spotifyAPI.getFromHref(
        nextHref,
        responseType: PagingObject<Artist>.self
    )
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            print("completion: \(completion)")
            dispatchGroup.leave()
        },
        receiveValue: { artistsPage in
            print("received \(artistsPage.items.count) artists:")
            for artist in artistsPage.items {
                print(artist.name)
            }
            
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)
    dispatchGroup.wait()
